## About Me

Hi, I'm Marcos Pontes. I'm mainly concerned about how we can access, represent, and retrieve data effectively and with high accuracy in search engines and databases. Nevertheless, I'm also interested in many other computer science stuff, especially Machine Learning. I'm currently in the final stages of my Computer Science graduation at UFOP (Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto) and I'm trying to live healthy in an intersection between industry and academic research in this weird world.
